Herein is code for a vector-symbolic implementation of a Lisp interpreter. The interpreter is admittedly slow and inefficient and the Lisp is restricted to the minimal operators sufficient for Turing-completeness. But the code constitutes a proof-of-concept that Lisp can be implemented using a vector-symbolic architecture.

The interpreter is described formally in the following paper. If you are looking to cite this code, cite this paper:

> Flanagan, E.T. & Kelly, M. A. (2024). Hey Pentti, we did it!: A fully vector-symbolic Lisp. In *Proceedings of the 22nd International Confernece on Cognitive Modeling*. Tilburg, the Netherlands: Tilburg University.

The code is written by E. Tomkins-Flanagan and M. A. Kelly by modifying the minimal Lisp interpreter written in Python by Peter Norvig.

The original code by Norvig can be found here:
